# Meetup Guideline

Good meetups requires planning. Here are some things to think about when planning a meetup:

- location: 
  - places that are convenient and accessible to people, preferably around LRTs
  - has space large enough to accomodate a large group
  - get sponsors for location by asking companies around (setup a Google Forms)
- duration:
  - depending on the number of speakers
- time: 
  - weekdays: best time would be after work (7:30 p.m. - 9:30 p.m. in Malaysia) 
  - weekends: preferably Saturdays, as most people would treat Sunday as rest time/family time
- speakers
  - one of the toughest challenge is to get good speakers, find them by posting in relevant groups
  - setup a Google Forms for people to register as speakers
  - it's better to get speakers to talk about things that are relevant to the subject, not just some opinionated thoughts on certain technology
- topics:
  - workshop: mix of presentation and hands-on on a particular topic. If the group size is large, consider getting some volunteers/mentors to help out.
  - presentation: in-depth talk on a specific topic with demo
  - lightning talk: for shy presenters that just want to give a quick talk on a specific topic
  - discussion: group of people debating on a particular topic
- target audience:
  - nocode: red flag, this is most likely a marketing event like AWS
  - beginner: almost zero knowledge in the particular topic
  - intermediate: most meetups should fall into this category. The audience are mostly developers (has some experience in coding) and are ready to meddle with more advance stuff
  - pros: mostly opinionated debates on advance stuff which will leave newbies clueless, prefer to isolate this from normal events
- food:
  - Again, Google Forms to get sponsors. Choices are limited to Pizza, KFC, sushi (?)
- recording:
  - ask for permission if doing recording
  - requires additional information from the presenters too
- sponsors:
  - maintain a list of sponsors in Google Docs
  - get their phone number/email for future reference
- volunteers/mentors
  - get a list of people in the community to help out
  - get their phone numbers/email for future reference
