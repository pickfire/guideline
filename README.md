# guideline

This is not a place for code monkeys, and hence we will be defining some practices and guidelines for the community here. While it is not a **must** to follow any of these, it is recommended to apply them and improve on them.

At engineers.my, we are trying to foster and develop a new breed of developers - one that are "stackless" and also 10x developers.
