# Maintainer

There are several maintainers in engineers.my in order to balance the workload, and to spread influence across Malaysia.

Currently we only have two main teams, one maintaining the services (APIs) and websites and another will be focusing on video recording.

## Roles

- Production Recording - responsible for managing the recording team
- Events Manager - responsible for managing events (approval, addition/removal, scraping)
- Community Manager - responsible for networking with others
